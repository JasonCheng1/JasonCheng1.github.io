Hi, my name is Jason Cheng. This is my personal website. My plan here is to have blog posts on technical topics including: computer science, software engineering, and mathematics.

## Background
I'm currently a software engineer at Akuna Capital. I graduated with a bachelor's in computer science from Rutgers Univerity - New Brunswick in December 2021. During college, I also had the opportunity to intern at Optum, 84.51Â°, Amazon, and PathAI. My career passion is in full-stack development and big data, and over the past year I started to take an interest in finance (so expect some blog posts on that).
